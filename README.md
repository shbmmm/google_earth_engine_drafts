# google_earth_engine_drafts

## Overview

`google_earth_engine_drafts` is a repository dedicated to the development and experimentation with Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts. This repository contains drafts and runs of GEE code editors, along with various plots generated from the analysis. It serves as a sandbox for testing and refining scripts before implementing them in more polished projects.

## Features

- **Google Earth Engine Scripts**: Contains various scripts for analyzing geospatial data using Google Earth Engine.
- **Code Editor Runs**: Includes runs of code editors, providing examples and outputs of different geospatial analyses.
- **Data Visualization**: Features plots and visualizations generated from the analysis, showcasing the results of the GEE scripts.

## Contents

- **Scripts**: A collection of GEE scripts organized by functionality and purpose.
- **Plots**: Visual representations of data analysis results, providing insights into the geospatial patterns and trends.
- **Documentation**: Notes and documentation on the usage and purpose of each script, aiding in understanding and replication of the analysis.

## Requirements

- Google Earth Engine account
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript for GEE scripting
- Tools for viewing and analyzing plots (e.g., Python with Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google_earth_engine_drafts.git
   cd google_earth_engine_drafts
   ```

2. **Explore the scripts**:
   Browse through the `scripts` directory to find various GEE scripts. Each script includes comments and documentation to help you understand its functionality.

3. **Run the scripts in GEE Code Editor**:
   - Open Google Earth Engine Code Editor at [code.earthengine.google.com](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
   - Copy and paste the desired script into the Code Editor.
   - Modify the script parameters as needed and run the script to see the results.

4. **View the plots**:
   Explore the `plots` directory to see the visualizations generated from the GEE scripts. These plots provide a visual summary of the analysis results.
